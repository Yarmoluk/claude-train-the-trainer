# Chapters

Chapters are organized in a progressive sequence from foundational knowledge through program operations. Each chapter is designed to stand alone for targeted use, but the full sequence provides the deepest learning path.

## Foundation

| Chapter | Title | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [1](ch01.md) | Understanding Claude | Building an accurate, teachable understanding of what Claude can and cannot do — capabilities, limitations, model behavior, and safety principles |
| [2](ch02.md) | Prompt Engineering Pedagogy | Teaching others to build prompt intuition through the RICO framework, anti-pattern recognition, and structured practice sequences |

## Design

| Chapter | Title | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [3](ch03.md) | Workshop Design and Facilitation | Modular workshop architecture, session design sequence, and facilitation techniques specific to AI tool training |
| [4](ch04.md) | Content Adaptation for Audiences | Transforming core content for five audience archetypes using use-case substitution, depth gating, and risk calibration |

## Operations

| Chapter | Title | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [5](ch05.md) | Assessment Design | Competency framework, rubric design, prompt production and output evaluation instruments, and certification architecture |
| [6](ch06.md) | Quality Assurance for Training | Trainer observation protocols, calibration processes, drift detection, and feedback loop infrastructure |
| [7](ch07.md) | Scaling Training Programs | Champion networks, rollout sequencing strategies, operational infrastructure, and change management for AI adoption |
| [8](ch08.md) | Measuring Outcomes | Kirkpatrick framework applied to Claude training, leading and lagging indicators, stakeholder reporting, and continuous improvement |

## Reading Paths

**New to training AI tools:** Read chapters in sequence. Each chapter builds on the previous.

**Experienced trainer, new to Claude:** Prioritize Chapters 1 and 2, then jump to your area of need.

**Program leader focused on scale:** Chapters 6, 7, and 8 address operational and measurement concerns directly.

**Instructional designer building curriculum:** Chapters 3, 4, and 5 cover design and assessment architecture.
